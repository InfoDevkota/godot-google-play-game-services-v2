# Godot Google Play Game Services V2

I am just trying to

Add Play Games services to your game to get frictionless zero-click sign-in

for my game [Carrom Karrom: Carrom Board](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloggernepal.carrom)

- https://developers.google.com/games/services/console/enabling


## Development
Download the Godot AAR library for Android and place it in `app/godot-engine-library` rename it as `godot-lib.arr`

For this I have used `3.5.3-stable` (`godot-lib.3.5.3.stable.release.aar`)

link: https://godotengine.org/download/3.x/linux/

downloaded from: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/download/3.5.3-stable/godot-lib.3.5.3.stable.release.aar

mv godot-lib.3.5.3.stable.release.aar  godot-lib.aar
